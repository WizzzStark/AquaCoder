Welcome to AquaCoder, a real-time mermaid diagram interpreter designed for collaborative use 🤝. This platform leverages the power of Liveblocks to enable multiple users to work on mermaid diagrams simultaneously, in real-time 🚀. Whether you're a team of developers 👩‍💻👨‍💻, a group of students 📚, or just someone looking to create complex diagrams with others, AquaCoder offers a seamless and intuitive interface to bring your ideas to life 🌟.

## Features 🌈

- **Real-time Collaboration:** Work with team members on the same diagram in real time, thanks to the integration with Liveblocks 🤝.
- **Mermaid Support:** Full support for mermaid syntax, allowing you to create a wide range of diagrams including flowcharts, sequence diagrams, class diagrams, and more 📊.
- **Intuitive Interface:** A user-friendly interface that makes diagram creation as simple as typing markdown ✍️.
