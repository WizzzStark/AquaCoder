# AquaCoder

Welcome to AquaCoder, a real-time mermaid diagram interpreter designed for collaborative use. This platform leverages the power of Liveblocks to enable multiple users to work on mermaid diagrams simultaneously, in real-time. Whether you're a team of developers, a group of students, or just someone looking to create complex diagrams with others, AquaCoder offers a seamless and intuitive interface to bring your ideas to life.

## Features

- **Real-time Collaboration:** Work with team members on the same diagram in real time, thanks to the integration with Liveblocks.
- **Mermaid Support:** Full support for mermaid syntax, allowing you to create a wide range of diagrams including flowcharts, sequence diagrams, class diagrams, and more.
- **Intuitive Interface:** A user-friendly interface that makes diagram creation as simple as typing markdown.

## Getting Started

To start using AquaCoder, follow these simple steps:

1. **Visit [AquaCoder](#)**: Open your browser and go to the AquaCoder website.
2. **Create or Join a Room**: You can start a new diagram or join an existing session using a unique session ID.
